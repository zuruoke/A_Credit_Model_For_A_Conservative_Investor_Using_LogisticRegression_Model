A credit modelling project, which is a well known data science problem that focuses on modeling a borrower's credit risk. 

I'll be working with financial lending data from Lending Club. Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers 
who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. 

And I'll be training this model with from a Conservative Investor's standpoint 

In this project, I'll:

1. Prepare the data for machine learning
2. Train a model
3. Measure the accuracy of the model using an true positive rate and false positive rate error metrics
